: <<'DOCSTRING'
This script runs batched insertions of reply chains into a PostgreSQL database.  
It resumes from the last completed batch (based on the `root_id_progress` table)  
and processes batches until none remain in `root_ids`.

Key features:
- Uses recursive CTEs to build two-author reply chains from `filter` and `message_links`.
- Deduplicates messages by root and depth, merges same-author turns, and formats text in ChatML style.
- Inserts completed chains into the `chains` table with assistant/user role counts.
- Marks each batch as finished in `root_id_progress` for safe resuming.

Configuration:
- `PGUSER`: The Postgres user to connect with (default: `postgres`).  
- `DB`: The target database name (default: `maniac`).  
  Change these variables at the top of the script if your environment differs.

The script assumes the presence of:
- `root_ids` table with `batch` column,  
- `root_id_progress` table to track progress,  
- `filter` and `message_links` for building chains.

Exits when no more batches exist in `root_ids`.
